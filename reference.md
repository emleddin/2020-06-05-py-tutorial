Bugs
: Features of code that don't work as you hoped, or as intended.
You want to squash bugs.

Compiler
: Translates the lines of code to a functional (or buggy) program.

Counter
: Breaks a looped section of code into something that can be tracked
numerically.
Counters are useful for tracking cases, such as when every time a condition
is met, the counter updates.
At the end, the counter would list the total number of uses.

Directory
: A folder. You probably have a Documents folder on the computer you use most often.

Distro
: Short for distribution, means a packaged format of a code or program.

Docstring
: Short for documentation string, it provides a long form for commenting and
otherwise describing code.

String
: Text-based things like filenames or text. `x = "Thing"`

Source Code
: Code in its pure form, before it is interpreted by a compiler.
