This is more of "highlights" lesson.

## The Universe System

Topologies and coordinates are loaded in through *universes* in MDAnalysis (MDA).
It can read in and write many of the common structure formats, including
those used with AMBER, CHARMM, GAMESS, GROMACS, LAMMPS, and TINKER.
<!-- - Example with different types of files (PDB, XYZ, TXYZ, Prmtop/Inpcrd) -->

The only necessary argument for creating a universe is a topology-based
`filename`.
~~~
import MDAnalysis as mda

system = mda.Universe(filename, in_memory=True)
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Memory with MDAnalysis
>
> The above example includes the keyword argument `in_memory=True`.
> Trajectory information can be a massive drain on compute resources, so by
> default, this is set to `False`, instead only loading 1 frame at a time.
> Thus, almost every analysis operation relies on using `for` loops to iterate
> through every frame.
> For relatively small trajectories, however, (like QM/MM optimizations that are
> often less than 10 frames), it can be easier to just load in everything at once.
{: .callout}

To change the loaded frame, you need to specify the frame number to change to
(again, keeping in mind that they start at zero).
You can use `-1` to specify the final frame.
```python
u.trajectory[-1]
```
You can verify that the timestep has been changed by printing it.
```python
> u.trajectory.ts
< Timestep 99 with unit cell dimensions [76.5608  70.27321 80.72006 90.      90.      90.     ] >
```

Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are
[assumed by default](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mdnalysis-discussion/zSjweyX1nqo/phv8-0eQAwAJ).
To turn off PBC, you would need to use an
[on-the-fly transformation](https://www.mdanalysis.org/docs/documentation_pages/trajectory_transformations.html)
(not covered here).

## Loading Different File Types

Most of the file types can be read using their commonly used extensions,
however, there are certainly times where specifying the file format is
necessary.
For instance, XYZ files and TINKER XYZ files are formatted differently, but
both may use the XYZ extension.
Thus, it is important to specify the TINKER format, because the file would only
be read correctly if the extension was `.txyz`.
```python
## Read in a TINKER XYZ
system = mda.Universe("my_tinker_file.xyz", format='TXYZ')
```

Trajectories can be loaded in a chain format, meaning that you can "stack" them
after loading an initial topology file.
```python
## Read in an AMBER topology and trajectory
system = mda.Universe("protein.prmtop", "protein_1.nc", "protein_2.nc",
    "protein_3.nc", "protein_4.nc", "protein_5.nc")
```

One of the keyword arguments you can feed the `Universe` command is `dt` to
specify the timestep.
The `dt` value should be the time in picoseconds between two frames.

<!-- Check the PDB coordinates are actually read, otherwise switch comment -->

> ## Load a Tinker XYZ

## Atom Groups

One of the best aspects of MDA is its atom selection language.
You can store specific atoms selected from a universe as new variables.
The command to do this is: `mda.Universe.select_atoms("")`.

A short example for selecting all the alpha carbons (CA) in a protein is below.
```python
import MDAnalysis as mda
u = mda.Universe("5Y2S_wat.prmtop", "5Y2S_wat.dcd")
C_alphas = u.select_atoms("protein and name CA")
C_alphas
```
~~~
<AtomGroup with 254 atoms>
~~~
{: .output}

You can also make selections with slices of atoms.
These selections use the Python indexing system, not the numbering in the
file.
Thus, the count starts at zero (*because Python starts at 0*), and it does
not include the final index.
```python
first_ten = u.atoms[0:10]

print(first_ten)
```
~~~
<AtomGroup [<Atom 1: N of type N3 of resname HIE, resid 1 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 2: H1 of type H of resname HIE, resid 1 and segid SYSTEM>,
...,
<Atom 9: HB3 of type HC of resname HIE, resid 1 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 10: CG of type CC of resname HIE, resid 1 and segid SYSTEM>]>
~~~
{: .output}
To further emphasize this point, the `0` index is shown as `Atom 1`, and the
`10` index, which would then be listed as `Atom 11` is not included.

One way to select atoms by the atom indices within the file is with `bynum`.
```python
res_15 = u.atoms.select_atoms("bynum 226:247")
print(res_15)
```
~~~
<AtomGroup [<Atom 226: N of type N of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 227: H of type H of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 228: CA of type CX of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
...,
<Atom 245: HZ3 of type H of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 246: C of type C of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 247: O of type O of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>]>
~~~
{: .output}

The above example selected all the atoms of a residue by number, but the
`resnum` keyword can do similarly.
You can use `list(group_name[:])` to print everything in that group.
```python
LYS_15 = u.select_atoms("resnum 15")
list(LYS_15[:])
```
~~~
[<Atom 226: N of type N of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 227: H of type H of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 228: CA of type CX of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 229: HA of type H1 of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 230: CB of type C8 of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 231: HB2 of type HC of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 232: HB3 of type HC of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 233: CG of type C8 of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 234: HG2 of type HC of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 235: HG3 of type HC of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 236: CD of type C8 of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 237: HD2 of type HC of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 238: HD3 of type HC of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 239: CE of type C8 of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 240: HE2 of type HP of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 241: HE3 of type HP of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 242: NZ of type N3 of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 243: HZ1 of type H of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 244: HZ2 of type H of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 245: HZ3 of type H of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 246: C of type C of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>,
<Atom 247: O of type O of resname LYS, resid 15 and segid SYSTEM>]
~~~
{: .output}

For many systems, `"resnum 15"` and `"resid 15"` should both give the same
result.

MDA also has syntax for selections based on masks, such as atoms or distance.
Distance masks select atoms within in a certain distance cutoff (in angstroms).

This example would select any atoms within 5 Ã… of the ZN6 residue.
```python
ZN_WAT = u.select_atoms("around 5 resname ZN6")
```
~~~
> ZN_WAT
<AtomGroup with 46 atoms>
~~~
{: .output}

You can extend this listing to include the entire residues that contain those
atoms.
```python
ZN_WAT = ZN_WAT.residues.atoms
```
~~~
> ZN_WAT
<AtomGroup with 150 atoms>
~~~
{: .output}

In the example, there were 46 atoms within a 5 A radius, but 150 total atoms
for all the residues with atoms within that radius.

AtomGroups can be combined into larger groups, as well.
If order is important, use `+`. This may keep duplicates.
If it is important to not repeat atoms, then `|` makes a union.
You can force a group to be sorted and without duplicates after-the-fact with
`unique`.
```python
## Just adds them and keeps them unordered
res_300 = u.select_atoms("resnum 300")
ZN_WAT = u.select_atoms("around 5 resname ZN6")
ZN_coord_and_300 = res_300 + ZN_WAT + res_300
```
~~~
> ZN_coord_and_300
<AtomGroup with 52 atoms>
~~~
{: .output}

```python
## Makes a union without duplicates
res_300 = u.select_atoms("resnum 300")
ZN_WAT = u.select_atoms("around 5 resname ZN6")
ZN_coord_and_300 = res_300 | ZN_WAT | res_300
```
~~~
> ZN_coord_and_300
<AtomGroup with 49 atoms>
~~~
{: .output}

```python
res_300 = u.select_atoms("resnum 300")
ZN_WAT = u.select_atoms("around 5 resname ZN6")
ZN_coord_and_300 = res_300 + ZN_WAT + res_300
ZN_coord_and_300_u = ZN_coord_and_300.unique
```
~~~
> ZN_coord_and_300_u
<AtomGroup with 52 atoms>
~~~
{: .output}

## Setting Up Analysis

MDA keeps a lot of functions in sub-modules that also must be loaded in,
which is one way to keep the package loading relevant.
```python
import MDAnalysis as mda
from MDAnalysis.analysis import align, rms, hbonds
```

The bulk of analysis scripts using MDAnalysis will be setting up precisely
what you're trying to analyze or compare.

There is currently a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/issues/2377)
about potentially creating command-line tools for MDA.

### Alignments

It can be useful to align different structures (like those with mutations).
The `mda.analysis.align.AlignTraj(moving, reference)` command can align an
entire trajectory to a specified reference structure.
The `reference` group is the second \*\*kwarg.
However, because of the assumption that PBC are turned on for the data, this
should not be necessary for general analyses.
After setting up the information to run the alignment, use `.run()` to
perform the action.

```python
moving = u.select_atoms("protein")
reference = ref.select_atoms("protein")

alignment = mda.analysis.align.AlignTraj(moving.universe, reference.universe)
alignment.run()
```
```
<MDAnalysis.analysis.align.AlignTraj object at 0x8261b0ac8>
```
{: .output}

The alignment is now stored as `alignment` (though, like all things in Python,
you can name your own variables as long as you're consistent).

### RMSD

RMSD can compare the root mean square deviation between two similarly shaped
groups.
When using data from periodic boundary simulations, use whole-residues for
comparison.
The actual command to set up an analysis is
`mda.analysis.rms.RMSD(group, reference_group)`. This is then run with `.run()`

```python
## Trajectory
system = mda.Universe("system.topology", "system.traj")

## Select residues/atoms of interest to calculate RMSD (inclusive)
ROI = 'resid 1:261'

## Reference (Crystal PDB)
ref = mda.Universe("crystal.pdb")

## Select atoms for RMSD
resnames = system.select_atoms(ROI)
resnames_ref = ref.select_atoms(ROI)

## Get the RMSDs
rmsd = mda.analysis.rms.RMSD(resnames, resnames_ref)
rmsd.run()

## Create a Pandas dataframe with info
rmsd_df =  pd.DataFrame(columns = ['#Frame', 'RMSD'])
for i in range(len(rmsd.rmsd)):
    rmsd_df = rmsd_df.append({
    ## First index is frame, then info is Frame, Time, RMSD aka [0, 1, 2]
    "#Frame" : rmsd.rmsd[i][0],
    "RMSD" : rmsd.rmsd[i][2]
    }, ignore_index=True)

## Round to 4 digits
rmsd_df = rmsd_df.round(4)

rmsd_df.to_csv("rmsd.dat", sep='\t', index=False, encoding='utf8', header=True)
```

After `.run()`, the information can be saved as a `pandas` dataframe
(assuming you loaded it with `import pandas as pd`!!!)
`pandas` is a really handy package for working with tabular data and saving CSV
files.
The final line with `to_csv` saves the RMSD information to a file.

### RMSF

Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) information can also be calculated.
Since this is performed by-atom, the residue weights need to be
applied to the by-atom fluctuations in order to get the RMSF per residue.
The basic RMSF analysis is called with `mda.analysis.rms.RMSF(resnames)` and
then run with `.run()`.
The weighting part first gets the residue weights for every atom in the
specified atom group before using those weights through `accumulate` to apply
the average to the residue.

```python
## Run for individual residues
rmsf = mda.analysis.rms.RMSF(resnames)
rmsf.run()

## Apply weights to the by-atom fluctuations
weight_rmsf = []
for atom in range(len(rmsf.rmsf)):
    ## weight_rmsf = fluctuation * atom_mass / residue_mass
    weight_rmsf.append( (rmsf.rmsf[atom] *
     ( res_weights[atom] / rmsf.atomgroup[atom].residue.mass)) )

## Combine into by-residue value
byres_rmsf = resnames.accumulate(weight_rmsf, compound='residues')

## Create a Pandas dataframe with info
rmsf_df =  pd.DataFrame(columns = ['#Res', 'AtomicFlx'])
for i in range(len(byres_rmsf)):
    rmsf_df = rmsf_df.append({
    "#Res" : resnames.residues[i].resnum,
    "AtomicFlx" : byres_rmsf[i]
    }, ignore_index=True)

## Round to 4 digits
rmsf_df = rmsf_df.round(4)

rmsf_df.to_csv("rmsf.dat", sep='\t', index=False, encoding='utf8', header=True)
```
Like before, a `pandas` dataframe is created.

### Hydrogen Bond Analysis

MDA's search criteria for hydrogen bond analysis (HBA) does not have
information for AMBER, but it can be written explicitly as a new HBA class.
CHARMM and GLYCAM are the two force fields currently written into MDA for HBA.
When making the class that includes AMBER, it is safer to define the new HBA
command as a unique class, instead of redefining the MDA package's class.

```python
class HydrogenBondAnalysis_AMBER(mda.analysis.hbonds.HydrogenBondAnalysis):
    # use tuple(set()) here so that one can just copy&paste names from the
    # table; set() takes care for removing duplicates. At the end the
    # DEFAULT_DONORS and DEFAULT_ACCEPTORS should simply be tuples.
    #
    #: default heavy atom names whose hydrogens are treated as *donors*
    #: (see :ref:`Default atom names for hydrogen bonding analysis`);
    #: use the keyword `donors` to add a list of additional donor names.
    DEFAULT_DONORS = {
        'AMBER': tuple(set([
            'N','OG','OG1','OE2','OH','NH1','NH2','NZ','OH','N2','ND1','NE', \
            'NE1','NE2','N2','N3','N4','N6','O5\'', 'OD2', ])),
        'CHARMM27': tuple(set([
            'N', 'OH2', 'OW', 'NE', 'NH1', 'NH2', 'ND2', 'SG', 'NE2', 'ND1', \
            'NZ', 'OG', 'OG1', 'NE1', 'OH'])),
        'GLYCAM06': tuple(set(['N', 'NT', 'N3', 'OH', 'OW'])),
        'other': tuple(set([]))}
    #
    #: default atom names that are treated as hydrogen *acceptors*
    #: (see :ref:`Default atom names for hydrogen bonding analysis`);
    #: use the keyword `acceptors` to add a list of additional acceptor names.
    DEFAULT_ACCEPTORS = {
        'AMBER': tuple(set([
            'O','OD1','OD2','OE1','OE2','N','ND1','NE2','NZ','OG','OG1','O1',\
            'O2','O4','O6','N1','N3','N6','N7','O1P','O2P','O3\'','O4\'','OH'])),
        'CHARMM27': tuple(set([
            'O', 'OC1', 'OC2', 'OH2', 'OW', 'OD1', 'OD2', 'SG', 'OE1', 'OE1', \
            'OE2', 'ND1', 'NE2', 'SD', 'OG', 'OG1', 'OH'])),
        'GLYCAM06': tuple(set(['N', 'NT', 'O', 'O2', 'OH', 'OS', 'OW', 'OY', 'SM'])),
        'other': tuple(set([]))}
```

After it is defined, it can be run like the other analyses, specifying the
default distance and angle information. This is one analysis where `pbc` needs
to explicity be set to `True` for simulations with periodic boundary conditions.

```python
hbond = HydrogenBondAnalysis_AMBER(system, ROI, ROI, distance=3.0, angle=135.0, \
 forcefield='AMBER', pbc=True)
hbond.run()

## Save by frequency
new_hbond_df = pd.DataFrame(hbond.count_by_type())
new_hbond_df = new_hbond_df.sort_values(by=['frequency'], ascending=False)

new_hbond_df.to_csv("hbond.dat", sep='\t', index=False, encoding='utf8', header=True)
```

The HBA class was designed to be a little friendlier with `pandas`, which
is why there are not column names that have to be assigned.

## Writing Out Files

MDA can write out several formats, for single frames or many frames.
By default, it will write out the current frame that is loaded for single
frame usage.
You can print the information for the loaded frame through something like
`u.universe.trajectory.ts`, where `u` is a loaded universe.

```python
u.atoms.write("5Y2S_from_MDA.pdb")
```

This can be written more Pythonically, while explicitly specifying the frame.
```python
with mda.Writer(outfile, multiframe=False) as pdb:
    system.trajectory[-1]
    pdb.write(system)
```

## `pandas` and `matplotlib`

Now that we've talked about analysis, we can touch a little bit more about
using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
A lot of the MDA analysis commands wrote very cleanly to `pandas` dataframes.
These dataframes can often be easily plotted using `matplotlib`, a very
broadly used Python module for data visualization.

This is a minimal working example for reading in a data file as a dataframe
and plotting `#Frame` on the x-axis and `RMSD` on the y-axis.
The labels are then updated to reflect time and RMSD.
The plot is then saved as a `.png` using `plt.savefig` at 300 DPI.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

rmsd_in = '5Y2S_rmsd.dat'
rmsd_plot = '5Y2S_RMSD.png'

## Read the file as a pandas dataframe
rmsd_df = pd.read_csv(rmsd_in, sep='\t')

## Plot x and y
plt.plot(rmsd_df['#Frame'], rmsd_df['RMSD'])

## Update axes labels
plt.xlabel('Time (ps)')
plt.ylabel('RMSD ($\AA$)')

## Save the figure
plt.savefig(rmsd_plot, dpi=300)
```

The reading of a dataframe can be skipped using `plt.plotfile`.
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

rmsd_in = '5Y2S_rmsd.dat'
rmsd_plot = '5Y2S_RMSD.png'

## Plot the pandas dataframe while defining the axis labels with `names`
plt.plotfile(rmsd_in, cols=(0,1), delimiter='\t', \
    names=('Time (ps)','RMSD ($\AA$)'))

## Save the figure
plt.savefig(rmsd_plot, dpi=300)
```

Both of these produce this graph.
