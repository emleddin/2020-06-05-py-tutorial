## General

*Is OpenMM the only way to run simulations?*
:   Absolutely not.

*Am I only able to use an AMBER force field with OpenMM?*
:   That's a great question.

*Are there other ways to analyze trajectories?*
:   I assure you, `cpptraj` exists.

*Does MPI for Python exist?*
:    Boy howdy does it. You can read more in the [MPI for Python](M4py)
     documentation.
