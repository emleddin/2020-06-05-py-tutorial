## OpenMM

*Is OpenMM the only way to run simulations?*
:    Absolutely not.

*Are there multiple integrator types and barostats? Why did you choose the ones you did?*
:    Probably.

*Can I use a force field family other than AMBER with OpenMM?*
:    FIXME

*Can I only use the prmtop and inpcrd file formats as inputs?*
:    FIXME

*Does this work on both CPUs and GPUs?*
:    Yep.

*Does MPI for Python exist?*
:    Boy howdy does it. You can read more in the [MPI for Python](M4py)
     documentation.

## MDAnalysis

*Are there other ways to analyze trajectories?*
:    I assure you, `cpptraj` exists.
